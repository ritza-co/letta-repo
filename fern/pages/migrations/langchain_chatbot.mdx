This guide shows how to migrate a LangChain chatbot to Letta. While the example is simple, it demonstrates the core migration patterns you'll use for larger, more complex applications: replacing thread-based session management with persistent memory, converting stateless agents to stateful architecture, and eliminating manual state tracking.

By the end, you'll understand how to replace LangChain's `MemorySaver` with Letta's memory blocks, eliminate thread ID management from your application, convert session-based state to persistent agent state, and apply these patterns to tools, RAG, and multi-agent systems.

## Prerequisites

## An example LangChain chatbot

We'll start with a simple LangChain chatbot that remembers conversation history using LangGraph's `MemorySaver`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the chatbot file">
    Create a new file called `langchain_chatbot.py` and add the following code:

    ```python
    from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
    from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
    from langgraph.graph import START, MessagesState, StateGraph

    # Initialize the chat model
    model = init_chat_model("gpt-4o-mini", model_provider="openai")

    # Define the graph workflow
    workflow = StateGraph(state_schema=MessagesState)

    def call_model(state: MessagesState):
        response = model.invoke(state["messages"])
        return {"messages": [response]}

    workflow.add_edge(START, "model")
    workflow.add_node("model", call_model)

    # Add memory with MemorySaver
    memory = MemorySaver()
    app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

    # Configuration with thread ID for this conversation
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "user-123"}}

    # First message
    response = app.invoke(
        {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Hi, my name is Alice")]},
        config=config
    )
    print(response["messages"][-1].content)

    # Second message - same thread ID means it remembers
    response = app.invoke(
        {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="What's my name?")]},
        config=config
    )
    print(response["messages"][-1].content)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install required packages">
    ```bash
    pip install langchain-core langgraph langchain-openai langchain
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your OpenAI API key">
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the chatbot">
    ```bash
    python langchain_chatbot.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

You should see output like:

```
Hello Alice! How can I help you today?
Your name is Alice.
```

The chatbot remembers Alice's name because we used the same `thread_id` for both messages. If we changed the thread ID in the second message, the chatbot would have no memory of the first conversation.

### Understanding the LangChain patterns we'll migrate

This simple example contains the core patterns you'll encounter in all LangChain applications—whether they use tools, RAG, or multi-agent systems. Let's break down the key components we'll need to replace.

#### Thread-based session management

```python
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "user-123"}}
```

LangChain requires you to manually create, track, and pass thread IDs for every conversation. In production, this means database tables mapping users to thread IDs, cleanup jobs for abandoned threads, session affinity in load balancers, and the risk of using the wrong thread ID. This pattern repeats in every LangChain app—tools use the same thread config with every invocation, RAG systems tie retriever state to threads, and multi-agent systems require complex graph state management across threads.

#### In-memory state storage

```python
memory = MemorySaver()
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```

The `MemorySaver` keeps state only in your application's memory. When the program stops, all conversations are lost. For production persistence, you'd need PostgreSQL checkpointer setup, database schema migrations, connection pooling configuration, and manual state cleanup.

#### Graph workflow definition

```python
workflow = StateGraph(state_schema=MessagesState)

def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    response = model.invoke(state["messages"])
    return {"messages": [response]}

workflow.add_edge(START, "model")
workflow.add_node("model", call_model)
```

LangChain requires explicit workflow graph definition even for simple linear flows. You define state schemas, create nodes for each step, and manually wire them together with edges.

We'll eliminate all of these patterns by migrating to Letta's persistent memory model.

## Migrating to Letta

Now we'll convert the LangChain chatbot to Letta step by step. We'll create a new file for the Letta version so you can compare them side by side.

### Install Letta and initialize the client

First, install the Letta Python client:

```bash
pip install letta-client
```

Create a new file called `letta_chatbot.py` and start with the imports and client initialization.

### Replace library imports with platform client

LangChain is a library that runs inside your application's process. Letta is a platform where agents run as a service. Your application makes HTTP requests to interact with agents.

This means your application stays lightweight. In LangChain, your pods need memory for model inference, pod affinity rules for session continuity, and database connection pooling for state. In Letta, you just need an HTTP client. Agents run on the platform, so you don't manage inference, state, or coordination.

Replace the LangChain imports:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import START, MessagesState, StateGraph
```

With the Letta import:

```python
from letta_client import Letta
```

Then replace the entire workflow setup:

```python
# Initialize the chat model
model = init_chat_model("gpt-4o-mini", model_provider="openai")

# Define the graph workflow
workflow = StateGraph(state_schema=MessagesState)

def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    response = model.invoke(state["messages"])
    return {"messages": [response]}

workflow.add_edge(START, "model")
workflow.add_node("model", call_model)

# Add memory with MemorySaver
memory = MemorySaver()
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```

With the Letta client initialization:

```python
# Initialize Letta client with your API key
client = Letta(token="your-letta-api-key-here")
```

Notice how much simpler this is. Letta handles the model, workflow, and memory management on the server, so you don't need to configure any of that locally.

### Replace MemorySaver with memory blocks

LangChain's `MemorySaver` stores conversation history implicitly as an in-memory message list. It disappears when your program stops.

Letta uses explicit memory blocks that define what the agent should remember. The `human` block stores what the agent learns about the person. The `persona` block defines how the agent sees itself. These persist automatically on Letta's servers.

Remove the thread config code:

```python
# Configuration with thread ID for this conversation
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "user-123"}}
```

Add agent creation with memory blocks:

```python
# Create an agent with memory blocks
agent = client.agents.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    memory_blocks=[
        {
            "label": "human",
            "value": "I don't know the human's name yet."
        },
        {
            "label": "persona",
            "value": "I am a helpful assistant who remembers conversations."
        }
    ]
)

print(f"Created agent: {agent.id}")
```

### Replace thread-based messaging with agent messaging

LangChain requires thread IDs passed with every request. You create thread IDs, store them in a database mapping users to threads, and pass a config dictionary with every call. Your load balancer needs session affinity rules to route users to the correct pod.

Letta uses agent IDs. Each user maps to an agent, and any pod can serve any request because state lives on the platform. No config dict, no thread management, no session affinity.

Replace the LangChain message code:

```python
# First message
response = app.invoke(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Hi, my name is Alice")]},
    config=config
)
print(response["messages"][-1].content)

# Second message - same thread ID means it remembers
response = app.invoke(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="What's my name?")]},
    config=config
)
print(response["messages"][-1].content)
```

With the Letta version:

```python
# First message
response = client.agents.messages.create(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hi, my name is Alice"
        }
    ]
)

# Print the assistant's response
for message in response.messages:
    if message.message_type == "assistant_message":
        print(message.content)

# Second message - agent remembers automatically
response = client.agents.messages.create(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's my name?"
        }
    ]
)

# Print the assistant's response
for message in response.messages:
    if message.message_type == "assistant_message":
        print(message.content)
```

The key difference: there's no `config` parameter and no thread ID. Letta agents maintain their state automatically. The agent ID is all you need.

The response also includes more detail than LangChain. Letta returns multiple message types including reasoning (the agent's internal thoughts), tool calls, and the final assistant message.

## The Complete Letta Chatbot

Here's the full `letta_chatbot.py` file after migration:

```python
from letta_client import Letta

# Initialize Letta client with your API key
client = Letta(token="your-letta-api-key-here")

# Create an agent with memory blocks
agent = client.agents.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    memory_blocks=[
        {
            "label": "human",
            "value": "I don't know the human's name yet."
        },
        {
            "label": "persona",
            "value": "I am a helpful assistant who remembers conversations."
        }
    ]
)

print(f"Created agent: {agent.id}")

# First message
response = client.agents.messages.create(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hi, my name is Alice"
        }
    ]
)

# Print the assistant's response
for message in response.messages:
    if message.message_type == "assistant_message":
        print(message.content)

# Second message - agent remembers automatically
response = client.agents.messages.create(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's my name?"
        }
    ]
)

# Print the assistant's response
for message in response.messages:
    if message.message_type == "assistant_message":
        print(message.content)
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your Letta API key">
    ```bash
    export LETTA_API_KEY="your-letta-api-key-here"
    ```

    Or pass it directly in the code:

    ```python
    client = Letta(token="letta_xxxxx...")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the migrated chatbot">
    ```bash
    python letta_chatbot.py
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    ```
    Created agent: agent-abc123...
    Hello Alice! Nice to meet you.
    Your name is Alice!
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing Your Agent in the ADE

The Agent Development Environment (ADE) lets you see what your agent is thinking and what it remembers.

Visit [app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com) and log in. Navigate to the **Agents** section in the dashboard where you'll see your agent listed:

<img className="w-300" src="/images/migrations/agent-dashboard.png" />

Click on your agent, then select **Open in ADE** to access the Agent Development Environment:

<img className="w-300" src="/images/migrations/agent-dev-environment.png" />

In the ADE, you can view:

- **Memory blocks**: See what the agent has stored in its `human` and `persona` blocks
- **Message history**: Every message exchanged with the agent
- **Reasoning steps**: The agent's internal thoughts (chain-of-thought)
- **Context window**: What the agent sees when it processes messages

After the first message, the agent updated its memory block to remember Alice's name. This happens automatically through Letta's built-in memory management tools.

The ADE provides observability that would require custom tooling in LangChain. You can inspect memory to see exactly what the agent remembers, watch reasoning traces to understand the agent's decision-making process, monitor tool calls to see which tools agents invoke and why, and view the context window to understand what's loaded in context versus archival.

<Note>
This built-in observability becomes critical when debugging agents with tools, RAG pipelines, or multi-agent coordination.

In LangChain, you'd need to build custom logging to see which tool was called with what parameters, what documents were retrieved from your vector store, or how state flows between agents. With Letta's ADE, all of this is visible by default.
</Note>

## What we eliminated in the migration

The LangChain version required workflow graph definition, state schema setup, MemorySaver configuration, and thread config management. 

The Letta version accomplishes the same functionality with just agent creation and message sending.

More importantly, we avoided infrastructure you'd need to build for a production LangChain app. Our simple example used in-memory `MemorySaver`, which loses all conversations when the program stops. A real application would need:

- Database setup for PostgreSQL checkpointer
- Thread lifecycle management code to create and track thread IDs per user
- Session cleanup jobs to remove abandoned threads
- State synchronization logic across your application servers

With Letta, none of this infrastructure exists because agents persist their state automatically on the platform.

## Applying these patterns to your application

Now that you understand the core migration patterns, here's how to approach larger LangChain applications.

Start by identifying session and thread management code (like we removed here), mapping state to memory blocks (like `human` and `persona`), converting from library calls to API calls (like we did with `client.agents.create`), and testing that state persists across restarts.

If your app uses tools, the same pattern applies. Register tools with Letta server, attach to agents, and eliminate thread configs. See the [Custom Tools](/guides/agents/custom-tools) guide.

If your app uses RAG (vector stores, retrievers), replace document loaders and vector stores with Letta's filesystem. Upload files to folders and attach to agents. See the [Letta Filesystem](/guides/agents/filesystem) guide.

If your app uses multi-agent systems (LangGraph supervisors), replace graph coordination with shared memory blocks. See the [Multi-Agent Shared Memory](/guides/agents/multi-agent-shared-memory) guide.
